Place the landing background image here:

- Filename: landing-bg.jpg (or landing-bg.png)
- Path after placing: Frontend/public/landing-bg.jpg
- Recommended size: at least 1600px width; 2k or 4k for very large screens
- Tip: Use a dark, desaturated image for best text contrast. If needed, tweak the overlay opacity in `src/App.css`.

The app CSS currently uses `url('/landing-bg.jpg')` as the page background. Restart the dev server (if running) to see the change.
